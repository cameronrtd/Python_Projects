# Projects in Python

## Project 1: snake_game
The creation of the original snake game (no touching the sides!)

The game is simple. You start out as a small snake. Dots will appear on the screen - they are your food. 
The hungry snake that you are will eat as much food as you can, growing a little with every bite, until eventually
you grow so large that it becomes impossible to not bumb into yourself!

### Rules: 
1) No touching the sides. Touch the sides and you die.
2) No touching yourself (hehe). Touch yourself and -you guessed it -you die.

### Controls:
To move up and down, left and right, simply use the direction (arrow) keys on your keyboard.

### Technical Functionality:
Run the programme from main.py. With object-oriented programming (OOP), main.py creates objects from classes defined in the other python files, food.py, scoreboard.py, and snake.py. So long as you have all files saved in the same folder, the programme should run smoothly. Simply open main.py and execute the code. 

Have fun!

## Project 2: Pomodoro Clock

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into 25-minute intervals, called pomodoros, separated by short breaks. The technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s while he was a university student.

I have set the time intervals to one minute each for testing purposes. To use the app properly, edit the time interval lenghts in the main.py file.
